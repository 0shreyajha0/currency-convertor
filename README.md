# AngularJS Currency Converter

This is a simple app I made using AngularJS + real time API from [apilayer.net].

### How to Get The API KEY?

Go to [apilayer.net] and register for free account. You'll get an API after you've signed up.

Copy it and insert it inside the api_key variable like so:

```
var api_key = "abcd1234...xyz789";
```

### Result Visual Style

I created 2 styles for the result data.

- **OPTION 1**: Unordered list style (it's commented and not active)
- **OPTION 2**: Table style (it's active by default)

Only choose 1. I prefer table style. :)

### Depedencies

This app require no 3rd party dependencies. It's 100% running on vanilla AngularJS. No need to inject anything.
